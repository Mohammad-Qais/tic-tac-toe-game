A simple two player tic-tac-toe game created in Python3.

This is one of my first python projects, its almost too simple.

Run the py file and enter player names, game chooses a random person to begin first. Enter cell row and column number to mark your x's and o's. The program announces the name of winner or if there is a tie.
